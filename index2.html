A Grassroots Awareness Movement with a clear message to make Government and Community accountable for promoting
active engagement in Health, Education, Eco-awareness and security for all citizens of Tanzania.
<BR/><BR/>
Nipe Fagio is a program aimed at sensitizing the public to a culture of cleanliness and individual responsibility. Through
creative social marketing and networking Nipe Fagio sets out to be a platform to promote best practice, policy, regulation,
technology, social responsibility investment and environmental health activities to help keep our communities clean,
attractive and consistent with climate change initiatives.
<BR/><BR/>
Our objective is to harness the power of community in collaboration with Government, municipal institutions, commercial and civil society groups to implement solutions for community hygiene, sanitation, environmental care, waste management and the provision of recreational spaces.<BR/><BR/>The program has been initiated to combat the chronic problems we face in our communities as a result of poor hygiene and sanitation practice due to either; the lack of awareness or the laxity of government policy, by-laws or community agendas. In order to improve upon the current situation we need to invest in a appropriate program of action targeting the rising levels of degradation, pollution, crime and disease particularly in urban areas. We believe that through collaborative efforts we can promote improved hygiene and sanitation practice, prevent crime, create business opportunities, raise property values, promote tourism and improve community standards with opportunities to enjoy clean, attractive and safer recreational activities<BR/><BR/>Scope<BR/>Nipe Fagio is an environmentally friendly call to action in areas that need creative solutions that bring benefit to all parties involved:<BR/>To take effective action on littering, waste, graffiti, fly-posting, nuisance and unauthorized activities, hawking, illegaldumping, noise pollution, curb maintenance and landscaping.<BR/>To link in with other council strategies and policies including community safety,<BR/>licensing and planning control.<BR/>To promote adherence to regulation and enforcement<BR/><BR/>Objectives<BR/>To use available resources to connect all parties creatively in an appropriate manner to bring <BR/>about beneficial change to society<BR/>To work effectively with other service providers and regulators to maximize effectiveness and to <BR/>avoid duplication<BR/>To provide clear guidance to the community on the Councilâ€™s powers duties and jurisdiction<BR/>To work closely with the community to achieve implementation of all developments and improvements<BR/>To obtain community support for an enforcement strategy<BR/>To build a sustainable and affordable environmentally integrated waste management system<BR/>To acknowledge and recognize community support<BR/>
